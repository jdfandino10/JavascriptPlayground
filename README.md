# JavascriptPlayground
Simple javascript coding place. Ideal if needed to compute simple values fast.
For example, if for whatever reason I need numbers from 1 to 1000 separated by comas,
you can easily do that with this tool. Why not use some computer program or language
for that? Well, this makes it easy and fast to get an answer.
Off course, there are more tools available online, but I just wanted to experiment a bit
and see how something like this works.

## Installation
